Pastebin.com is a website where you can store text for a certain period of time. The website is mainly used by programmers to store pieces of sources code or configuration information, but anyone is more than welcome to paste any type of text. The idea behind the site is to make it more convenient for people to share large amounts of text online. Users have the ability to make private pastings, so they are only visible to the people they choose to share their links with.

When you create an account you get your own Pastebin. This means you can now store pastes and have full control over them at any point in the future. Having your own Pastebin is also great for sharing your pastes with others. Your Pastebin is both public and private at the same time. Your public pastes are visible to everybody in your own Pastebin, and the private ones are only visible to you.

With the launch of Pastebin v3 (current version), we removed the option to paste under a subdomain. You are now able to create your own Pastebin when you signup for an account. You will get a unique link which you can share with others where all your pastes are listed.

Broadly speaking, the site was created to help programmers. Any paste or usage pattern not related to that goal which results in unusually high traffic will be flagged for investigation. Your paste may be deleted and your IP blocked. <strong>In particular, please do not paste email lists, password lists or personal information.</strong> The "report abuse" feature can be used to flag such pastes and they will be deleted. Do not aggressively spider the site. Exceptions can be arranged, contact me to discuss. If you can access pastebin.com from one location, but not another, it's likely your IP address has been blocked for violating this policy. Get in touch and the block can be lifted.

If you make a public paste (public by default), your paste will show up for everybody on the site at the top of the menu on the left. Anyone is able to click on your pastes, however, you are able to make your pastes private. Also search engines will only index public pastes, not private ones.

You are only able to remove pastes that were created while you were logged in. If you pasted something as a guest, there is no delete option. But you can contact Pastebin.com and ask them to remove something manually, be sure to tell use why you want a paste to be removed.

We allow pastes to be made up to 1024000 bytes, or 1 megabytes. This is should be enough for almost any script, and it prevents people from jamming our servers. PRO members are allowed to create pastes up to 10 megabytes.
